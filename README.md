TypeScript: Working with classes, constructors, interfaces, implementation of interfaces, and transpiling .ts files to .js

These are the instructions as given:

"1. Create a Class with name ‘Greeter’ in greeter.ts and define Constructor and one
‘greet()’ method which will return some greeting message, then create a
greeter.html, add compiled file into this html like(greeter.js). Output should
display as greeting message.

2. Create Interfaces and Class for implement them.
Interface: A simple interface that defines the interface for something that can
drive.
Class: An implementation of a car.
interface Drivable {}, with start(), drive() and getPosition()
class Car implements Drivable {}

3. One more exercise for Interface and class as mentioned above:
 interface Flyable { ... }
class Helicopter implements Flyable { ... }
class FlyingCar implements Drivable, Flyable { ... }"
